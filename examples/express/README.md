# Custom server example with Express, Nodemon, Varnish, and react-esi

This example demonstrates how to set up an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server using JavaScript and how to leverage [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) for live reloading of the server code. Additionally, it introduces caching optimization with a [Varnish](https://varnish-cache.org/intro/) server and the `react-esi` library using `esi:include` tags.


The server entry point is `server.jsx` in development and `dist/server.js` in production.
