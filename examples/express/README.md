# Custom server example with Express and Nodemon

This example demonstrates how to set up an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server using JavaScript, and how to leverage [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to live reload the server code.



The server entry point is `server.jsx` in development and `dist/server.js` in production.
